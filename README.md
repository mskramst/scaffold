## Starting templates for a new project in different programming languages

* Used by github.com/mskramst/dev

* Work in progress as new languages are added and templates refined with modern,
updated versions.

To change permissions outside of container you must use:

chown -R username:username directory

* Will add in future the ability to build docker image with permissions passed
    inside to container: see article: https://vsupalov.com/docker-shared-permissions/
